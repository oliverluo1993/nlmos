\begin{abstract}
Spatially localized molecular orbitals are of tremendous importance in the electronic structure theory as they are widely used to describe chemical bonding and speed up calculations.
Nonorthogonal localized molecular orbitals (NLMOs) are known to be noticeably more localized than their conventional orthogonal counterparts. 
Unfortunately, the existing methods to obtain NLMOs must pre-determine and freeze the localization center of each NLMO before its spread is minimized. 
This is done to avoid the “collapse” of the occupied subspace – a problem of NLMOs becoming linearly dependent. 
In this paper, we describe an unconstrained black-box method to localize nonorthogonal orbitals that determines the position of their centers automatically during the optimization process. 
The key to the new procedure is to construct and impose a penalty function which prevents the orbital “collapse”. 
An algorithm is proposed to adjust the strength of the penalty and produce the right balance between orthogonality and locality of NLMOs. 
The resulting method produces NLMO fast, without requiring good understanding of bonding patterns in the system (i.e. “chemical intuition”) and is demonstrated to work well a variety of molecules and materials (gamma-point only) including large systems with non-trivial bonding patterns.

\section{Introduction} 

%1. Why LMOs and maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs) are important?

One-electron orbitals, which are defined as molecular orbitals (MOs) in the molecular systems and Bloch orbitals in the solid state field, play a paramount important role in electronic structure theory. 
Delocalized canonical molecular orbitals (CMOs) are widely implemented in current electronic structure calculations due to they have well defined energies and associated orbital energies. 

Localized MOs (LMOs) and their condensed-phase equivalent maximal localized Wannier functions (MLWFs) provide an equivalent description of the electron distribution in one-electron theories (Hartraa-Fock, Density Functional Theory) and are widely used to describe the chemical bonding patterns since the classical chemical bonding theory describes the bonding properties as the localized distributed electrons.
The conventional electronic structure methods experience high-cost and slow running time problems when applied to large systems, because of the need of the cubic scaling operation to diagonalize the Hamiltonian matrix.
To overcome the limitation, researchers have focused on developing the LS methods.
LMOs have been proposed to be an extremely promising candidate to achieve LS calculations in many local electron correlation electronic structure methods.~\cite{wang1992simple, ordejon1993unconstrained, mauri1993orbital, mauri1994electronic, stechel1994n_scaling, goedecker1994efficient}

Early developments of the LMOs were constrained to be orthogonal (OLMOs)~\cite{weinstein1971localized} which can be obtained through unitary transformations from CMOs based on extremizing the localization functions, such as Boys-Foster~\cite{boys1960construction}, Edmiston-Ruedenberg~\cite{bytautas2002electron, bytautas2003split, edmiston1963localized}, Pipek-Mezey~\cite{pipek1989a_fast}, and Von Niessen methods~\cite{niessen1972density}.
Due to the orthogonality condition of the OLMOs, the "orthogonalization tails" outside the localization center can be observed in the generated OLMOs.
These "orthogonalization tails" reduce the localization and complicated the electronic structural information transformation from one system to another.

Since nonorthogonal LMOs (NLMOs)~\cite{anderson1968self, diner1968fully, magnasco1974localized, payne1977hartree, mehler1977self} are obtained by nonsingular transformation from CMOs without the orthogonality condition, more degrees of freedom are available during the generation of NLMOs, resulting in a more localized distribution of electrons in space.
The concept of NLMOs was firs introduced by Anderson~\cite{anderson1968self} and Diner et al~\cite{diner1968fully} in 1968, but more efforts were devoted to constructing OLMOs previously.
Several efforts have been made to develop the method to construct NLMOs recently~\cite{feng2004An_efficient, liu2000nonorthogonal, peng2013effective, hoyvik2017generalising}, and researchers have proposed that NLMOs are about $10-30 \%$ more compact than OLMOs~\cite{feng2004An_efficient, liu2000nonorthogonal}.

One way to construct NLMOs is to employ the variational optimization by restricting the variational space to a local space.
The NLMO is then expanded in the variational space, which helps to eliminate the long-range tails.
However, this approach may introduce error due to the basis set truncation and lead to result in the very approximation NLMOs because the choice of the local space may be different from the true localization region.

Other studies proposed another method to obtain NLMOs by linear transformations of CMOs with relaxation of the orthogonality constraint.~\cite{feng2004An_efficient, cui2010efficient} 
The limitation of this method is that the final MOs either are still fairly orthogonal and similar localization compared with OLMOs or lead to the linear dependence between the orbitals.~\cite{feng2004An_efficient} (we will refer to the linear dependence problem as the collapse problem.)
To overcome the collapse problem, Yang and co-workers~\cite{feng2004An_efficient, cui2010efficient}  developed a method to construct NLMOs by fixing the centers of NLMOs during the minimization of the spread functional. 
The positions of the centers are predefined from the corresponding OLMOs~\cite{feng2004An_efficient} or good understanding of bonding patterns in the systems (i.e.``chemical intuition'')~\cite{cui2010efficient}.
While this method solved the linear dependence problem, it still needs more computational efforts to construct OLMOs centroids and to know the bonding properties in advance by using "chemical intuition", which may limit the application of the method.

In this paper, we propose a fully black box method to construct the NLMOs without the need of predefined centroids.
With the new approach, NLMOs can be obtained by automatic minimization the unconstrained spread functional with the  penalty functional which prevents the orbital collapse.
We successfully developed this new black-box approach to obtain NLMOs and achieved more compact and nonorthogonal MOs compared with OLMOs.

\section{Theory and algorithms}

The localization procedure starts with a set of occupied (or ZZZ virtual?) one-electron states $\ket{i_0}$. 
These orbitals are not assumed to be canonical or even orthogonal. 
However, they are assumed to be normalized. 
Furthermore, they must be linear independent, that is, their overlap matrix $\sigma_{ji}^0 \equiv \braket{j_0}{i_0}$ must be invertible. 
The trial NLMOs are expressed as a linear combination of these initial states
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\ket{j} = \ket{i_0} {A^i}_j  
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%
The conventional tensor notation is used to work with the nonorthogonal orbitals~\cite{head1998tensor}: covariant quantities are denoted with subscripts, contravariant quantities with superscripts, and summation is implied over the same orbital indices.

The objective function minimized in this work contains two terms: a conventional localization functional $\Omega_L$ and a term that penalizes unphysical states with linearly dependent occupied orbitals $\Omega_P$:
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fun-pen}
\begin{split}
\Omega(\mathbf{A}) = \Omega_L(\mathbf{A}) + c_P \Omega_P(\mathbf{A}), \\
\Omega_P(\mathbf{A}) = - \log \det \left[ \sigma (\mathbf{A}) \right]
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%
where $c_P > 0$ is the penalty strength, $\sigma$ is the NLMO overlap matrix 
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\sigma_{kl} = \braket{k}{l} = {A^j}_k \sigma_{ji}^0{A^i}_l
%= (\mathbf{A}^\dagger \mathbf{T}^\dagger \mathbf{ S T A})_{kl},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%

If the NLMOs are normalized the determinant of $\sigma$ varies from 1 for orthogonal NLMOs to 0 for linearly dependent NLMOs. The penalty function---the key ingredient of the proposed method---varies from 0 to $+\infty$ for these two extreme cases, making linearly dependent state inaccessible in the localization procedure with finite penalty strength $c_P$. 
% RZZK: Why sigma instead of A? quadratic penalty in terms of A (more complicated in terms of a). Why log?
A normalization constraint can be imposed on NLMOs if their coefficients are expressed in terms of independent variational parameters denoted with lowercase $\mathbf{a}$
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
{A^i}_j = {a^i}_{j} ({a^k}_{j} \sigma^0_{kl}{a^l}_{j})^{-\frac{1}{2}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%
The inclusion of the penalty term converts the localization procedure into an unconstrained and straightforward optimization problem. Additionally, adjusting the strength of the penalty $c_P$ enables one to achieve the right balance between the nonorthogonality and locality of the orbitals. 
%RZK: We will demonstrate below that this flexibility is useful because a high degree of linear dependence  
A procedure that finds the penalty strength for the desired compromise between the nonorthogonality and locality is discussed below. 

In this work, we adopted the following localization functional 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fun-loc}
\begin{split}
\Omega_L(\mathbf{A}) &= - \sum_K \sum_i \omega_K \log \vert z_{i}^{K} \vert^2, \\
z_{i}^{K} &= {A^m}_i B^{K}_{mn} {A^n}_i, \\
B^{K}_{mn} &= \bra{m_0} \E^{\imi \mathbf{G}_K \cdot \mathbf{\op{r}}} \ket{n_0}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%

%RZZK - minus sign ensures minimization vs maximazation
%RZZK - use other functions?
%RZZK - Explain how Boys functions are obtained.
where $\omega_K$ , $\mathbf{G}_K$, $\mathbf{\op{r}}$ - RZK. Summation over $K$ is written out explicitly because $K$ is not an orbital index. This functional can be used for both periodic (ZZZ at $\Gamma$-point only?) and gas-phase systems~\cite{berghold2000general}. In the latter case, it is equivalent to the Boys localization functional~\cite{RZK}.

There exists a multitude of algorithms to carry out the unconstrained minimization of functional $\Omega$ with fixed $c_P$. In this work, we used a simple conjugate gradient algorithm summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:cg}. The gradient ${G_i}^j \equiv \frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial {a^i}_j}$  required in the algorithm is a sum of the localization ${L_i}^j \equiv \frac{\partial \Omega_L}{\partial {a^i}_j}$ and penalty ${P_i}^j \equiv \frac{\partial \Omega_P}{\partial {a^i}_j}$ components
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:grad}
\begin{split}
G{_k}^{l} = L{_k}^{l} + c_P P{_k}^{l}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%
These components can be readily expressed in terms of the derivatives with respect to the transformation coefficients $\tilde{X}{_k}^l \equiv \frac{\partial \Omega_X}{\partial {A^k}_l}$, where $X$ is either $L$ or $P$:
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:grad-convert}
\begin{split}
{X_i}^j & = \tilde{X}{_k}^l \frac{\partial {A^k}_l}{\partial {a^i}_j} = \tilde{X}{_i}^j \sigma_{jj}^{-\frac{1}{2}} - \sigma_{in}^0 {A^n}_j  \sigma_{jj}^{-\frac{1}{2}} {A^m}_j \tilde{X}{_m}^j
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:grad-loc}
\begin{split}
\tilde{L}{_k}^l & = - \sum_K \frac{4 \omega_K}{\vert z_{l}^{K} \vert^2} \times \\ 
&\times \left[  \operatorname{Re}(B^{K}_{kn}) {A^{n}}_{l} \operatorname{Re}(z_{l}^{K}) + \operatorname{Im}(B^{K}_{kn}) {A^{n}}_{l} \operatorname{Im}(z_{l}^{K}) \right]
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:grad-pen}
\begin{split}
\tilde{P}{_k}^l & = -2 \sigma_{km}^0 {A^m}_n \sigma^{nl} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%

\textbf{Adjusting penalty strength.} In the case of extremely large $c_P$, $\Omega_L$ is negligible compared to the penalty term and the minimization of $\Omega$ is equivalent to a trivial orbital orthogonalization. In the opposite case of extremely small $c_P$, the minimization of $\Omega$ leads to a linear dependence between NLMOs and the failure of the algorithm in Figure~\ref{fig:cg}. % to invert the NLMO overlap in Eq.~(\ref{eq:grad-pen}). 
The strategy of finding the optimal penalty strength adopted in this work is to use moderately large initial $c_P$ value and perform the minimization of $\Omega$ gradually decreasing $c_P$ until the value of the determinant of the NLMO overlap drops below a desired threshold value $\epsilon_{\text{Det}} \in (0,1)$. The initial value of $c_P$ is chosen so that the 
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
c_{P} \gets - \Omega^0_{L}(\Omega^0_P + \log \epsilon_{\text{Det}})^{-1}  
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%
The logic behind this equation: but the functional before optimization must be larger than after 
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Omega^0_{L} + c_P \Omega^0_P > \Omega^{\text{expected}}_L - c_P \log \epsilon_{\text{Det}} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%
which results in
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
c_P > (\Omega^{\text{expected}}_L - \Omega^0_{L}) (\Omega^0_P + \log \epsilon_{\text{Det}})^{-1}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%
At the same time, the initial $c_P$ value must be as small as possible.

{\color{red} It might seem like a good idea to choose initial $c_P$ value that minimizes the Frobenius norm of the total gradient. The motivation is that the gradient of the localization component can be balanced as much as possible by the penalty gradient. In this case, the initial $c_P$ is given by the equation below (somewhat problematic index summation). The main reason not to use this initial value is that for $P_k^l$ is zero for all orthonormal states, giving infinitely large coefficient.
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
c_P = - \frac{ \sum_{nm} {L_m}^n {P_m}^n}{ \sum_{kl} {P_k}^l {P_k}^l}  
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end{figure}

To test our newly generated method, we performed the simulations on several systems from simple water molecule to large polymer and graphene systems (H$_2$O, CO$_2$, C$_3$H$_6$, C$_4$H$_6$, B$_2$H$_6$, B$_3$N$_3$H$_6$, C$_6$H$_6$, C$_7$H$_{16}$, C$_2$B$_{10}$H$_{12}$, C$_{20}$H$_{42}$, C$_{72}$H$_{24}$, graphene).
We employed the DFT method to generate the NLMOs and calculate the related quantities (localization functional and determinants of CMOs, OLMOs and NLMOs).
The optimization procedure is stable and relatively efficient in most of our tests.
The results are shown in the Table 1.
To illustrate the extent of the localization,  the Boys localization functional is calculated to compare between CMOs, OLOMOs and NLMOs.
Yang et al.~\cite{feng2004An_efficient, cui2010efficient} have previously shown that, based on their prefixed centers algorithms, the NLMOs are more compact than the corresponding OLMOs with about $10\%$ to $30\%$ in the value of spread functional.
Our algorithms gave the relatively similar results with theirs.
The results of localization functional of the CMOs, OLMOs and NLMOs are tabulated in columns of 2-4 of Table 1, respectively.
The relative decreases of the localization functions of the OLMOs to CMOs and NLMOs to OLMOs are also reported in the table.
Among our tested systems, the relative percentage of OLMOs compared with CMOs range from $20.5\%$ to $97.5\%$, while that of NLMOs to OLMOS is from $6.7\%$ to $27.5\%$.
The average decreases of OLMOs and NLMOs localization functional are $69.9\%$ and $16.8\%$.

The determinants controlled by the penalty strength are listed in the last column of the table for all systems, which indicate the orthogonality of the obtained NLMOs.
The final determinant value has shown that all obtained NLMOs are linear independent and do not collapse into each other.
The relationships between the relative penalty strength with determinant and localization functional is illustrated in the Fig. 2.
The first vertical axis describes the change of localization functional with different penalty strength during the minimization procedure, with the second axis reports the final determinants.
The yellow dot line describes the minimized value localization functional of OLMOs, with the green dash-dot line marks as the maximum determinant 1.0, which also indicates the determinant of OLMOs.
The trend of the localization function and final determinant versus penalty strength grow in the same way as we expected.
With weakening the penalty strength, we obtained more localized and nonorthogonal MOs.
Even though the final determinant could go down to extremely small value (such as $10^{-7}$ ) in some systems, we set 0.09 as the final determinant cutoff since we suspect some generated NLMOs may become linear dependent with those extremely small determinant values.
In some cases, we do observe the scenario described in the Theory section, which results in negligible localization functional and a trivial orbital orthogonalization problem when using extremely large penalty strength at the beginning of the optimization.
According to the Fig. 2, we can conclude that our method successfully generates linear independent NLMOs based on totally black-box algorithms.

Although the obtained NLMOs are substantial more localized than the NLMOs in terms of the value of localization functional, it is still not clear how much the spatial difference between them.
By visualizing the generated NLMOs and OLMOS, we can show how much the different those orbitals look like.
Figure 3 and 4 are a few NLMOs and OLMOs obtained from our tests.
Figure 3 contains the OLMO and NLMO of carbon atoms covalent bond for C$_2$B$_{10}$H$_{12}$ molecule with 0.05 isosurface value.
The shape of the corresponding OLMO and NLMO are extremely similar, but the OLMO occupied more space compared with the NLMO, which also indicated the obtained NLMO is more compact than the OLMO.
The Previous study has proved that two adjacent C atoms form 3 center 2 electron B–C–B bonds and a classical C–C bond in ortho-carborane molecule.\cite{melichar2018systematic}
It can be seen from the Fig.3 that both OLMO and NLMO can well present the complicated bonding pattern, without requiring "chemical intuition" and pre-determined orbital centers in the system.
The obtained NLMOs and OLMOs  are completely equivalent to each other and to the CMOs in their representation of the electronic structure.

We now consider the calculations on the periodic graphene sheet.
Figure 4 is two NLMOs (upper panel ) and OLMOs (lower panel), respectively, one for C-C $\sigma$ bond and the other for $\pi$ bond in the graphene system with 0.06 isosurface value.
The $\sigma$ bond can be well reproduced by both of the OLMO and NLMO, while both of the MOs fail to present the traditional $\pi$ bond in graphene.
While the generated NLMOs are more localized and reasonably representative of the $\pi$ bond compared with OLMOs due to its more compact property, but the shape of the MO is more like a mix between $\sigma$ and $\pi$ bond instead of a pure $\pi$ bond because of the limitation of the Boys localization functional.

It is well known that OLMOs attain orthogonality tails whose presence is crucial for OLMOs to satisfy the orthogonal condition, while NLMOs which remove the orthogonalization constrain tend to get smaller tails and more compact orbitals. 
To illustrate and compare the tail difference between OLMOs and NLMOs, we plot the NLMO and OLMO of C$_{72}$H$_{24}$ with smaller isosurface value (0.003).
According to the Fig. 5, we can conclude that the thickness of the orthogonality tails is reduced for the localized NLMOs compared to the orthogonal counterpart.

In summary, we found that NLMOs are significantly more compact and less tails than corresponding OLMOs based on our newly proposed black-box method. 
We successfully developed a new approach, which minimize the Boys localization functional and automatically self-adjust penalty function, to generate NLMOs without the need of understanding the bonding patterns in the system or any pre-fixed/defined NLMO centers.
But we also encountered several problems  in our method.
We observed the convergence rate issue in some systems due to we only use the gradient instead of Hessian as the new line search direction.
Also, as we mentioned before, the Boys localization functional tends to mix the $\sigma$ and $\pi$ bond during the minimization procedure, so the $\pi$ bond of NLMOs we obtained are slightly different from the traditional bonding pattern.
This problem is possible to be solved if we use Pipek-Mezey~\cite{pipek1989a_fast} localization scheme.
Even though obtained NLMOs with our method have less orthogonality tails compared with conventional OLMOs, we still could observe the significantly existence of tails when using small isosurface value, which means the generated NLMOs are still not nonorthogonal enough to eliminate the tails when using second order localization functional.

We hope this issue can be solved when applying higher order localization functional.

\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we proposed an unconstrained black-box method to localize nonorthogonal orbitals that automatically determine the NLMOs' centers during the optimization process without any pre-understanding/defined bonding patterns in the system. 
The adjustable penalty function strength allows us to manually regulate the balance between orthogonality and locality of NLMOs.
Our calculations show that the optimization is stable and fast in our most tested systems.
With the help of the penalty function, we did not observe linear dependence issue among generated NLMOs.

Our results, which agree with previous research by Yang et al~\cite{feng2004An_efficient, cui2010efficient}, show that the NLMOs are around $7\%$ and $28\%$ more compact than the corresponding OLMOs and mostly accordance with the traditional chemical bond theory.
Also, we  can conclude that these NOLMOs can be used to present the electronic structure in the completely equivalent to the representations by the OLMOs and CMs.
Moreover, we found that the orthogonal tails are significantly reduced in the NLMOs compared with the OLMOs.
The faster tail decay for nonorthogonal orbitals is due to more degree of freedom are available without using the orthogonality constrains for nonorthogonal orbitals than orthogonal orbitals.

\section{Computational details}
All calculations were preformed using DFT as implemented in the CP2K software package.~\cite{cp2kgeneral}
The energy of all molecules was evaluated using periodic boundary conditions.
CP2K relies on the mixed Gaussian and plane-wave representation of the electronic degree of freedom~\cite{hutter2014cp2k}.
The localized atom-centered Gaussian basis sets were used for constructing molecular orbitals and the plane waves were used to construct the Kohn-Sham matrix efficiently.
The Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr generalized gradient approximation~\cite{becke1988density, lee1988development} was used as the exchange-correlation functional.
Goedecker-Teter-Hutter pseudopotentials~\cite{goedecker1996separable} were used together with a triple-$\zeta$ Gaussian basis set with two sets of polarization functions for all atoms.
The energy cutoff of 200 Ry was used to define the plane-wave basis set.
The integration over the Brillouin zone was performed using the gamma point.
We chose the final determinant cutoff as 0.09, so we dismiss all generated NLMOs with final determinant less than 0.09 to prevent orbital from collapsing.
